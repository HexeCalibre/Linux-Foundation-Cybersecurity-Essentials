# About Cybersecurity Awareness
Cybersecurity Awareness is understanding the potential dangers posed by technology and the knowledge of how to use technology securely and safely to protect individuals, organizations, and societies. It encompasses the understanding of the importance of protecting sensitive data and systems from cyberattacks, the recognition of potential cyber threats, and the adoption of safe practices to prevent or mitigate such threats. Cybersecurity Awareness is essential for individuals and organizations to stay protected in today's digital age.

The rapid development of technology and the methods we use to communicate and share information with friends, family, and colleagues has increased the possibility of cybersecurity breaches.

Opportunities to steal data from personal and work devices are easier for online criminals when we do not safeguard networks, devices, and applications. Cybercriminals take advantage of stealing information from a wide variety of sources including (but not limited to) social media posts, email, and online business transactions conducted at the local coffee shop or gas station.

#### Objective:
- Recognize cybersecurity benefits to protect personally identifiable information

## Cybersecurity Awareness for Government Workers
If you are a government worker, your access to valuable information makes you a prime target for hacking activity and cybersecurity attacks. This is especially true if you work in Defense, Transportation, Energy, Healthcare, or one of the sixteen critical infrastructure domains on the [Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) website](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/what-cybersecurity). Remember, everyone is a target when it comes to cybersecurity.

## What is Cyberspace?
Cyberspace refers to the interconnected network of information technology systems, including the internet, telecommunication networks, and computer systems.

> ***It is a virtual space where people can communicate, access information, and conduct various activities online.***

Cyberspace has transformed how we live, work, and interact, providing many benefits and opportunities. However, it has also created new security challenges as sensitive information and systems are vulnerable to cyberattacks and other forms of cybercrime.

As a result, cybersecurity is an essential consideration in cyberspace to protect individuals, organizations, and societies from cyber threats.

## What is a Hacker?
A hacker is a person or group using technical skills to gain unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, or other technology-based resources.

The term "hacker" has a negative connotation, as it is often associated with cybercrime and unauthorized access to sensitive information.

However, the skills of hackers can also be used for good to help organizations identify and fix security weaknesses and improve their cybersecurity.
