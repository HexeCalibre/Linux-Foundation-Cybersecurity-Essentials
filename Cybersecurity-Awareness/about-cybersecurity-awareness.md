# About Cybersecurity Awareness
Cybersecurity Awareness is understanding the potential dangers posed by technology and the knowledge of how to use technology securely and safely to protect individuals, organizations, and societies. It encompasses the understanding of the importance of protecting sensitive data and systems from cyberattacks, the recognition of potential cyber threats, and the adoption of safe practices to prevent or mitigate such threats. Cybersecurity Awareness is essential for individuals and organizations to stay protected in today's digital age.

The rapid development of technology and the methods we use to communicate and share information with friends, family, and colleagues has increased the possibility of cybersecurity breaches.

Opportunities to steal data from personal and work devices are easier for online criminals when we do not safeguard networks, devices, and applications. Cybercriminals take advantage of stealing information from a wide variety of sources including (but not limited to) social media posts, email, and online business transactions conducted at the local coffee shop or gas station.

#### Objective:
- Recognize cybersecurity benefits to protect personally identifiable information
